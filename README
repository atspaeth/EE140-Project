Our final system is in proj/finalzilla. 
To run the tests, load the view "test" of proj/AAAA_theregoestokyo_testzilla. 
 (Which will turn up alphabetically first in the list.)

Explanation of the variables:
 vbat		Battery voltage.
 vin		DC voltage applied to input A0.
 b0, b1, b2	PGA gain select bits.
 s0, s1		Input select bits.
 ticks		Number of clock periods to simulate. 
 per		Period of the clock.
 trf		Rise and fall time of all clocks.
None of these propagate into the ADC or PGA, being only used by Finalzilla and
 its testbench.

Our project is organized into two libraries: blocks and proj. Blocks contains
 the various digital stuff (muxen, inverters, level shifter, buffers, &c), 
 while proj contains the real 140 stuff: the op-amps, bandgap reference, 
 and the final ADC and PGA. 

We have accuratish results for most cases. Certainly didn't meet the spec, but
 it's functional. We'll tell you more about that on Friday!
We didn't make nonideal regulators, but there are no ideal sources that aren't
 visible in the top-level view of Finalzilla; there, you can see that Vdda, Vref
 and Vddd are all generated by VCVSes referred to Vbgr.
The clocks are of course ideal.
